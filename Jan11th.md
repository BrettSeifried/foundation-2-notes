Step 4a: Wireframe and Navigation
For your MVP features, create rough wire frames of the pages and navigation flow you will need. Don't worry about fine-grain detail, just get the basic pages in place and what is on each page.

Does this change your understanding of MVP?

Step 4b: User Story Cards
Write out cards for the things you'll need to build to make those features happen. Consider all aspects (navigation and workflow, design, styling, functionality, user interaction, data persistence, etc.)

For each card, estimate how hard (time and complexity) that it will take to build that thing. Don't use units of time, use relative estimation using Fibonacci sequence numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). For those you rate 8, can you split into smaller pieces (13 might mean too big to do ðŸ˜‰). Discussion among team members is encouraged as to what they see is complex, hard, easy, simple - as someone may be noticing something others are missing.
